This is the last project I will code with HTML and CSS before I will start to learn JavaScript.
For this project i chosed to reproduce opalbeauty.ro, a website of a local bussiness.
I will try to recreate a 1:1 replica, only where I see space for improvement, changes will be made.

For now the forcus is desktop first but the website will be responsive.
